    /// AVSpeechSynthesizer's own queue starts and stops the audio output around every utterance,
    /// which costs about 120 ms of silence per line for the compact voices and about 250 ms for
    /// Eloquence (measured August 2026 in the Say the Spire 2 port: four short lines took 1612 ms
    /// to play for 602 ms of speech); a screen reader user hears speech stopping and restarting on
    /// every line, and nothing on the utterance API changes it. So each message is rendered
    /// instead, with writeUtterance:toBufferCallback:, which delivers the same audio the voice
    /// would play in a fraction of its playing time with no silence in front and a few tens of
    /// milliseconds behind. The samples are trimmed (<see cref="SpeechAudio.Trim"/>) and scheduled
    /// back-to-back on an AVAudioPlayerNode of our own, in the voice's native format (Eloquence
    /// renders at 16 kHz, the compact voices at 22.05 kHz; the engine's mixer resamples to the
    /// output device). Our own AVAudioEngine, rather than the game's audio, keeps speech clear of
    /// the game's bus and gives it a volume of its own.
    ///
    /// One render runs at a time. AVSpeech delivers the buffers on a thread of its own through an
    /// Objective-C block built by hand here; the block writes into the <see cref="Render"/> in
    /// flight, and <see cref="Update"/> collects the result once per frame and starts the next. A
    /// render cannot be aborted (stopSpeakingAtBoundary: does not touch a write), so when one must
    /// be abandoned, on an interrupt or because it stalled, its synthesizer and block are retired
    /// with it and a fresh synthesizer takes the next message at once; a retired set is reaped, its
    /// block reused, only once no more callbacks can come - AVSpeech's nil end marker has arrived,
    /// or the render has been quiet for the stall timeout - so nothing the callback thread may
    /// still touch is freed under it. A render whose AUDIO is complete (a zero-frame buffer also
    /// marks that) but whose nil marker has not yet arrived is scheduled at once and its
    /// synthesizer retired the same way, never reused: a trailing callback into a reused block
    /// would land on the NEXT render's handle and end it with someone else's marker. Stopping the
